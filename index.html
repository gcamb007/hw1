                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Gerardo Cambronero, I am an Industrial Designer and User Experience (UX) consultant dedicated to the implementation of beautiful solutions to ill-design issues. My focus is to assist my clients through the design development process of new ideas and technologies, from initial concept to final prototype testing and project delivery. I have created work in fields such as consumer goods, trade show architecture, oil & gas, clean renewable energy, transportation design, futuristic habitat systems, and research and development of new and exciting technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    My design ideology emerges out of a careful analysis of how contemporary life constantly changes and the need for better infrastructure systems to sustain such demanding changes. I provide my clients with innovative, cost-effective, manufacturable, and marketable Industrial Design and User Experience solutions to provide fabrication-ready prototypes.
                    <br><br>        
                    My design development is of the highest quality and I effectively manage all changes to projects without unduly affecting the stated objectives, benefits, and overall intent. I implement design research, visual conceptualization, Human-Factors, and Human-Centered Design principles to enhance the user experience of existing and emerging technologies. I also provide graphic design services by creating collateral art material, photography, and interface design for web applications and website design.
